Important Points:-

1) Emails are being sent through SmartForms
2) Your OWN account email address is the default recipient - you must remove it first and set a new one!
3) New email addresses must be confirmed before they can receive submissions
4) If you're on the free plan, don't bother with the redirect URL ('Back URL')
3) The default response page can only be skipped on a paid plan!
3) Lastly, set the form's action attribute to the generated endpoint
4) Form should now be ready to receive submissions!

NB: If the form has attribute name='email', you can directly reply to the person who sent the message!
