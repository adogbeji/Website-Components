Important points:

1) This is a slightly different way to send emails via Formspree
2) Change the Form's action attribute to https://formspree.io/you@email.com --> replace [you@email.com] with your own/client's email
3) Add a hidden input field with name attribute set to: _subject. In the value attribute, you can now set the subject of the email
4) Add a hidden input field with the name attribute set to: _next. In the value attribute, you can now set a URL to redirect the user
   after form submission

5) In the email input field, set the name attribute to: _replyto. This will allow you directly respond to the person who sent the message
   through your site!
