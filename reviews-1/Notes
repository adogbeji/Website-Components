Important Points:-

1) This contains the code to build a testimonial/review section
2) It's better suited for longer reviews that a carousel
3) If you want to space out the asterisks a bit more, use the letter-spacing CSS property
4) Each column in your Bootstrap grid should occupy either a 1/4 or a 1/3 of the row. But don't use col-auto!!
5) After you've built the first card, just copy and paste the contents into the new card, then change the text as necessary
6) To see what it looks like, look at the PNG image in the 'preview-image' folder
