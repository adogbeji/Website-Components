Important Points:-

1) This contains code to build full-page tabs with CSS & JavaScript
2) the body and html selectors should be given 100% height to enable tabs occupy full browser window
2) Create buttons to open specific tab content
3) All divs with class="tabcontent" are hidden by default (CSS & JavaScript)
4) When the user clicks a button, it will open up the corresponding tab
5) Each tab must be given a unique ID which is then passed into the function triggered on button click
6) Each tab must also be given a background colour which is then passed into the function triggered on 
   button click
   
7) ONE tab must be open by default. Give its corresponding button a unique ID (id="defaultOpen"), so that 
   JavaScript can open it

8) The buttons should come BEFORE the tabs in your HTML, or else the buttons will be at the bottom!
9) The buttons should be given a width in %
10) The tabs should also be given a width that allows the buttons fit exactly 
   (eg. 75% for 3 buttons of width 25%)

11) To position the tabs, wrap it in a parent div, give it a set width (eg. 60%, 90%), apply the 
    margin: auto rule, and give it top and bottom padding
