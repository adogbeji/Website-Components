Important Points:-

1) Emails are being sent through Getform
2) Create a form and set action attribute to generated endpoint
3) The form must have a name attribute on every input tag
2) You must upgrade to a paid plan to set a custom redirect URL
4) All messages are sent directly to your Getform account - no need for client email address!
5) To send notifications to people, open the Form --> Settings --> Notifications --> E-mail notification (set recipient emails)
