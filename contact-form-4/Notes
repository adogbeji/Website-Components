Important Points:-

1) Emails are being sent through Getform
2) Create a form and set action attribute to generated endpoint
3) The form must have a name attribute on every input tag
2) You must upgrade to a paid plan to set a custom redirect URL
4) All messages are sent directly to your Getform account - no need for client email address!
5) To send notifications to people, open the Form --> Settings --> Notifications --> E-mail notification (set recipient emails)
6) On the free plan, you can only have ONE email recipient per form
6) You can automatically respond to the client by replying to the email received
