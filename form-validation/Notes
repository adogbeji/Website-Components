Important Points:-

NB: Icons are from Font Awesome

1) Give the Form a unique ID to target it with JavaScript
2) Each Input should have the following tags: label, input, 2X i & small
3) Check icon is shown when input is successful
4) Exclamation icon is shown when there's an error
5) <small></small> tag will display error message to user
6) Error message will be hidden by default (display: none) and only displayed upon error
7) Icons are hidden by default and only shown upon success/error validation
8) Use JavaScript to dynamically add one of two custom classes depending on whether its success or failure
9) Make corresponding icon visible upon success or failure
10) It's best for icon colour to be the SAME as input tag border colour
