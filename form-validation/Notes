Important Points:-

1) Place a Div above the form with a unique ID - error message will go here
2) Give form tag, input fields and error message Div a unique ID to target them with JavaScript
3) We need to catch errors BEFORE form submission
4) Solution: use JavaScript preventDefault() method to prevent form submission
5) You can make an input field required by adding the 'required' attribute to it
