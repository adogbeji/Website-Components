important Points:-

1) Scroll Button can be placed anywhere on your HTML, preferrably in Navigation Bar
2) The scroll button should be given equal with & height - but don't go below 40px!
3) JavaScript can be implemented in 3 different ways
4) In the first technique, we use the 'function' keyword rather than ES6 arrow functions (=>) to ensure Internet Explorer compatability
5) The second technique won't work with Internet Explorer! It's mainly limited to browsers like Chrome & FireFox
6) The third technique gives the BEST results in terms of cross-browser compatability & animation!!
7) In the third technique, we target BOTH HTML & body for browser compatibility. For some browsers, you 
   must target the body, and for others, you should target HTML. This strategy covers everything!

NB: Using jQuery (Technique #3) ensures maximum cross-browser compatability and is the recommended strategy!
