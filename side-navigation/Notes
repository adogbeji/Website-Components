important Points:-

1) This contains the code to build a Side Navigation Bar using CSS & JavaScript
2) All Page content should be kept in a wrapper div with a unique ID (eg. id="main")
3) Create a unique header partial for each web page that has a Side Navigation Bar
4) COMMENT OUT the navigation bar in the header partial - except scroll button- so it doesn't overlap 
   the Side Navigation Bar

5) Now COPY the navigation bar you once had in the header partial and put it inside the wrapper div
6) Displaying a greeting message isn't required - it's totally optional!
7) Button for opening the sidebar should be in a container that has the SAME background colour as the
   rest of the page

8) Main contents should be kept in a div directly beneath the opening button
