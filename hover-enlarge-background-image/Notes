Two scenarios to use this effect:-

1) BACKGROUND IMAGE: If you only have a background image, scale it in CSS with the :hover Pseudo-class. No need for JavaScript
2) TEXT CONTENT: If you have text/content in the middle, scale it using JavaScript instead rather than the CSS :hover Pseudo-class. JavaScript Functions MUST be triggered on the parent element only!!
