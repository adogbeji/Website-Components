Important Points:-

1) Emails are being sent through Basin
2) Create your form and click on the 'Setup' tab to get your URL endpoint
3) Paste the URL endpoint into your form's action attribute
4) Go to the 'Emails' tab to set recipient emails (+ cc), custom from name and email subject line
5) On the free plan, you can set multiple recipients but can only create ONE form
5) You must upgrade to a Pro account to set a custom Redirect URL
6) You can respond to the client by simply replying to the email received!

NB: Don't use Basin at the moment - their submission notification page doesn't work!!
